# Julia and Mandelbrot Picture Maker

This simple functions create simple plots of the Julia and Mandelbrot sets. The Julia set require the important parameter
for the equation C, the rest is pretty straightforward. I have added some examples and the images generated from them can be
checked out [here](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1pUbFgtscqd0Rr_kTHJrHg09fBzkUf_8A?usp=sharing).



## Prerequisites

Python knowledge to be able to call the functions and basic knowledge of the Mandelbrot
and Julia sets are recommended. Numpy and matplotlib libraries are necessary:

```
pip3 upgrade
pip3 install numpy
pip3 install matplotlib
```
